# Budget Tracker

  [![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://lbesson.mit-license.org/)

  This Node app uses a MongoDB database to keep track of the user's financial transactions. What makes this application especially useful is that it uses features of a Progressive Web App to give access even while offline. Transactions entered without an internet connection are saved locally and when connection is re-established, the transactions are bulk uploaded to the database.
